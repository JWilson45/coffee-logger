# Coffee Logger â˜•

A personal coffee brewing log built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) using a local SQLite database.

This app helps you track, analyze, and improve your coffee brewing by recording detailed entries including coffee name, roaster, process, brew time, water temp, and tasting notes.

```

### 3. Run the Dev Server

```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to start logging your brews.
